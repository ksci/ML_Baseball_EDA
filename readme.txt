The folder contains the following files/folders:

Baseball_Proejct_v1.0.pdf - This is my report

ProjectFiles - This folder contains all the Jupyter Notebooks I used to collect and analyze the data I used for this project.
it also includes the final csv files I created and used during data analysis.  These csv's were constructed from data I mined
from Baseball-Reference and Retrosheet.  The raw data from those websites is not included.  

I have so many notebooks because there were a lot oquestions I was pursuing and I was trying to keep things organized for
myself.  In the end, only a couple of them were that valuable.  Feel free to explore what you like, but here are the most
important notebooks:

Pipeline_team_and_player_stats:
	This includes the model results for Question 1 with the extended featureset

Pipeline_team_stats:
	This includes the model reults for Question 1 with the limited featureset

Win_V_Runs_Linear_Modelling
Win_V_Runs_Linear_Modelling_More_Stats:
	Same thing as the previous two notebooks, but looking at question 2 instead

EDA_WinRate_Probability:
	My first EDA looking at win probability vs winrate


Question 1: Can I predict which team will win a specific game

Question 2: Can I predict the number of wins in a season
